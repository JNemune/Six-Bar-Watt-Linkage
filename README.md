## **🛠 Requirements**  
To run this project, you need:  
- **GeoGebra** (to verify initial mechanism constraints)  
- **MATLAB** (to run kinematic and dynamic analysis)  
- **ADAMS** (to simulate the six-bar linkage)  
- **A media player** (to view animation and simulation videos)  

## **🚀 How to Use**  
1. Open **geogebra-export.ggb** in **GeoGebra** to examine the mechanism’s feasibility.  
2. Run **main.mlx** in **MATLAB** to compute kinematics and dynamics.  
3. Open **main.bin** in **ADAMS** to simulate motion and forces.  
4. Watch **main.avi**, **VID01.mp4**, and **VID02.mp4** to visualize different stages of the analysis.  
5. Refer to **Report.pdf** for a detailed explanation of methodology and results.  

## **📌 Future Improvements**
